TECHNICAL ARCHITECTURE

 

The technical architecture of our online complaint registration and management app follows a client-server model, where the frontend serves as the client and the backend acts as the server. The frontend encompasses not only the user interface and presentation but also incorporates the axios library to connect with backend easily by using RESTful Apis.


The frontend utilizes the bootstrap and material UI library to establish real-time and better UI experience for any user whether it is agent, admin or ordinary user working on it.


On the backend side, we employ Express.js frameworks to handle the server-side logic and communication. 


For data storage and retrieval, our backend relies on MongoDB. MongoDB allows for efficient and scalable storage of user data, including user profiles, for complaints registration, etc. It ensures reliable and quick access to the necessary information during registration of user or any complaints.


Together, the frontend and backend components, along with socket.io, Express.js, WebRTC API, and MongoDB, form a comprehensive technical architecture for our video conference app. This architecture enables real-time communication, efficient data exchange, and seamless integration, ensuring a smooth and immersive video conferencing experience for all users.
